### Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights Job Simulation!

This data analysis and visualisation was done as part of the Tata Data Visualisation Virtual Experience Programme.

During this programme, I worked on a project to help a retail client review their revenue data to prepare for the future. I created data visuals, practiced using PowerBI to represent information, and built my presentation skills in a real-world context.

Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working on strategic problems for clients
